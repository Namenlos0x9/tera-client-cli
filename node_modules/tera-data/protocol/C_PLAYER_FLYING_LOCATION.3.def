# x = forwards/backwards direction keys (1, -1 respectively)
# y = left/right direction keys (1, -1 respectively)
# z = ascend key (1) (descend doesn't set this)
# multiple of these components can be set at the same time, e.g.
# you can be flying forwards and ascending. note that if you're
# pressing two direction keys at the same time, you'll get
# something like <0.7071067, 0.7071067, 0> for forwards + right
# or <-0.7071067, -0.7071067, 0> for backwards + left.
