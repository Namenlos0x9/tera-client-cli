# TERA Client

## Information
NO SUPPORT!!!

> Current supported regions: NA (En Masse), EU (Gameforge), RU (Destiny -> [early support](https://github.com/Kloct/tera-auth-ticket))

This app functions smiliarly to the older [tera-discord-relay](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-discord-relay) and provides an API endpoint to the TERA game servers without the use of a client. The app supports native [tera-proxy](https://github.com/tera-proxy/tera-proxy) modules as well as some [tera-toolbox](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox) modules through a compatibility layer.

## Configuration

Using `TeraClient.bat` for the first time will initiate the configuration.

To reconfigure use `Config.bat`.

**Troubleshooting: *If you experiance problems after updating delete your old `settings/_tera-client_.json` and try again.***
